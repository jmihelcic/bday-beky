[Bedroom]


I'm very long and very black,
you will find your clue by my crack
- moew moew

I'm very lazy and very busy,
that why people call me buzz-y
- catbee

Usullay I hang from a tree,
but now im fourth in a row of many
- climby

Bright and round as the sun giving light,
and even then stars shine so so bright
- sunstar lamp

So pretty is the outside,
yet an invisible wall keeps me inside
- window

Behind the door versions of you,
behind the handle - your next clue
- mirror mirror

A fire that is not real,
find your clue under its wheel 
- fireplace

I know a lot I can carry,
but man... these glasses sure are heavy
- nounlets

Back and forth I can go all night,
but I'd rather not be in plain sight.
- fucky wucky

[Kitchen]

I just moved here not long ago,
and already have something stuck to my toe
- big table

Soon I shal be full and complete,
all that's left to do is to eat
- cock-heh-tail

Out of this world and they look so fine,
making sure to never forget the time
- aliens

Of thousand pieces I am made,
at my center find your fate
- woody the wall

Standing next to paper rags,
used for cooking and slaping eggs
- wooden spatuly

Held in place by black chains,
I used to have flashing pains
- flashy light

You turn me on when it gets hot,
I suck more when you turn the knob
- sucky fan

The Christmas time is so very near,
until then I'll just hang around here
- ho ho ho

[Bedroom]

Come back to where it all began,
there you'll find your lovely man
- piki!
